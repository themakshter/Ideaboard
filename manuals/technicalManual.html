			<h3>User Interface</h3>
			<p>IdeaBoard uses a nautral user interface, a natural user interface is one which is initally invisible, but whilst the user explores the application they discover and learn the supported functions. As such upon first seeing the board the user sees only a series of notes, however, upon hovering over with a mouse they can see UI interface elements to change colour and delete notes. When the user selects text a menu appears under their cursor allowing them to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create bullet points and numbered lists</li>
				<li>Make text bold or italic</li>
				<li>Create heading</li>
				<li>Make links</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Upon hovering over the end of a list or column a user discovers the new note or new column button. All of these appearing interface elements are animated to fade in and out, this is so that the user is not forced into sudden disorientating state changes when editing a board.</p>
